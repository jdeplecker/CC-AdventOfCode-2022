# Setup
Put a command computer in the bottom right position of the turtle wall. Let it run the day06.lua or the day06_part2.lua. It will spawn a background of white_concrete_powder that turns red on all the lines that violate the multiple turtles on a line constraint. The concrete will turn fully green once the solution is found and the solution index is printed in the console.
