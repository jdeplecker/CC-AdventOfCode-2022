# Setup
Put a command computer in the bottom right position of the board. Let it run the day05_command.lua. After running the initialization, put a mine turtle on the bottom left of the board. Facing the board.
Run the day05_turtle.lua to make it execute all the box moving. It will in the end check the top boxes itself.

Sadly I ran out of time today as the turtle took a very long time completing the first part of the puzzle. I'm still happy with the result gif. I solved part 2 with the same algorithm but in the turtles console by running day05.lua.
